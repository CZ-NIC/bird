================================================================================

The BIRD project aims to develop a dynamic IP routing daemon with full support
of all modern routing protocols, easy to use configuration interface and
powerful route filtering language, primarily targeted on (but not limited to)
Linux and other UNIX-like systems and distributed under the GNU General
Public License.

What do we support
==================

	o  Both IPv4 and IPv6
	o  Multiple routing tables
	o  Border Gateway Protocol (BGPv4)
	o  Routing Information Protocol (RIPv2, RIPng)
	o  Open Shortest Path First protocol (OSPFv2, OSPFv3)
	o  Babel Routing Protocol (Babel)
	o  Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD)
	o  IPv6 router advertisements
	o  Static routes
	o  Inter-table protocol
	o  Command-line interface allowing on-line control and inspection of
	   status of the daemon
	o  Soft reconfiguration, no need to use complex online commands to
	   change the configuration, just edit the configuration file and notify
	   BIRD to re-read it and it will smoothly switch itself to the new
	   configuration, not disturbing routing protocols unless they are
	   affected by the configuration changes
	o  Powerful language for route filtering, see doc/bird.conf.example
	o  Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD ports

How to install BIRD
===================

	o  From standard distribution package of your OS (recommended)
	o  From official binary packages for Debian and Red Hat Linux
	   ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/debian/
	   ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/redhat/
	o  From source code of the latest stable release version
	   ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/
	o  From current development code in Git repository
	   https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/bird/

See the file INSTALL for information about installation from source code.

Documentation
=============

Online documentation is available at http://bird.network.cz/?get_doc or as HTML
files in the doc directory, you can install it by `make install-docs' and
rebuild it by `make docs', but you'll need SGMLtools and LaTeX to be installed
on your machine. You can also download a neatly formatted PDF version as
a separate archive (bird-doc-*.tar.gz) from ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird/

User support
============

If you want to help us debugging, enhancing and porting BIRD or just lurk
around to see what's going to develop, feel free to subscribe to the BIRD
users mailing list bird-users@network.cz, just send `subscribe' to
bird-request@network.cz. Bug reports, suggestions, feature requests and
