/**
 * DOC: Neighbor cache
 *
 * Most routing protocols need to associate their internal state data with
 * neighboring routers, check whether an address given as the next hop
 * attribute of a route is really an address of a directly connected host
 * and which interface is it connected through. Also, they often need to
 * be notified when a neighbor ceases to exist or when their long awaited
 * neighbor becomes connected. The neighbor cache is there to solve all
 * these problems.
 *
 * The neighbor cache maintains a collection of neighbor entries. Each
 * entry represents one IP address corresponding to either our directly
 * connected neighbor or our own end of the link (when the scope of the
 * address is set to %SCOPE_HOST) together with per-neighbor data belonging to a
 * single protocol.
 *
 * Active entries represent known neighbors and are stored in a hash
 * table (to allow fast retrieval based on the IP address of the node) and
 * two linked lists: one global and one per-interface (allowing quick
 * processing of interface change events). Inactive entries exist only
 * when the protocol has explicitly requested it via the %NEF_STICKY
 * flag because it wishes to be notified when the node will again become
 * a neighbor. Such entries are enqueued in a special list which is walked
 * whenever an interface changes its state to up. Neighbor entry VRF
 * association is implied by respective protocol.
 *
 * When a neighbor event occurs (a neighbor gets disconnected or a sticky
 * inactive neighbor becomes connected), the protocol hook neigh_notify()
 * is called to advertise the change.
