/**
 * DOC: Object locks
 *
 * The lock module provides a simple mechanism for avoiding conflicts between
 * various protocols which would like to use a single physical resource (for
 * example a network port). It would be easy to say that such collisions can
 * occur only when the user specifies an invalid configuration and therefore
 * he deserves to get what he has asked for, but unfortunately they can also
 * arise legitimately when the daemon is reconfigured and there exists (although
 * for a short time period only) an old protocol instance being shut down and a new one
 * willing to start up on the same interface.
 *
 * The solution is very simple: when any protocol wishes to use a network port
 * or some other non-shareable resource, it asks the core to lock it and it doesn't
 * use the resource until it's notified that it has acquired the lock.
 *
 * Object locks are represented by &object_lock structures which are in turn a
 * kind of resource. Lockable resources are uniquely determined by resource type
 * (%OBJLOCK_UDP for a UDP port etc.), IP address (usually a broadcast or
 * multicast address the port is bound to), port number, interface and optional
 * instance ID.
