/**
 * DOC: Routing tables
 *
 * Routing tables are probably the most important structures BIRD uses. They
 * hold all the information about known networks, the associated routes and
 * their attributes.
 *
 * There are multiple routing tables (a primary one together with any
 * number of secondary ones if requested by the configuration). Each table
 * is basically a FIB containing entries describing the individual
 * destination networks. For each network (represented by structure &net),
 * there is a one-way linked list of route entries (&rte), the first entry
 * on the list being the best one (i.e., the one we currently use
 * for routing), the order of the other ones is undetermined.
 *
 * The &rte contains information specific to the route (preference, protocol
 * metrics, time of last modification etc.) and a pointer to a &rta structure
 * (see the route attribute module for a precise explanation) holding the
 * remaining route attributes which are expected to be shared by multiple
 * routes in order to conserve memory.

 * This function gets a routing table update and announces it
 * to all protocols that acccepts given type of route announcement
 * and are connected to the same table by their announcement hooks.
 *
 * Route announcement of type %RA_OPTIMAL si generated when optimal
 * route (in routing table @tab) changes. In that case @old stores the
 * old optimal route.
 *
 * Route announcement of type %RA_ANY si generated when any route (in
 * routing table @tab) changes In that case @old stores the old route
 * from the same protocol.
 *
 * For each appropriate protocol, we first call its import_control()
 * hook which performs basic checks on the route (each protocol has a
 * right to veto or force accept of the route before any filter is
 * asked) and adds default values of attributes specific to the new
 * protocol (metrics, tags etc.).  Then it consults the protocol's
 * export filter and if it accepts the route, the rt_notify() hook of
 * the protocol gets called.

 * @new: a &rte representing the new route or %NULL for route removal.
 *
 * This function is called by the routing protocols whenever they discover
 * a new route or wish to update/remove an existing route. The right announcement
 * sequence is to build route attributes first, allocate a temporary &rte, fill in all
 * the appropriate data and submit the new &rte by calling rte_update().
 *
 * @src specifies the protocol that originally created the route and the meaning
 * of protocol-dependent data of @new. If @new is not %NULL, @src have to be the
 * same value as @new->attrs->proto. @p specifies the protocol that called
 * rte_update(). In most cases it is the same protocol as @src. rte_update()
 * stores @p in @new->sender;
 *
 * When rte_update() gets any route, it automatically validates it (checks,
 * whether the network and next hop address are valid IP addresses and also
 * whether a normal routing protocol doesn't try to smuggle a host or link
 * scope route to the table), converts all protocol dependent attributes stored
 * in the &rte to temporary extended attributes, consults import filters of the
 * protocol to see if the route should be accepted and/or its attributes modified,
 * stores the temporary attributes back to the &rte.
 *
 * Now, having a "public" version of the route, we
 * automatically find any old route defined by the protocol @src
 * for network @n, replace it by the new one (or removing it if @new is %NULL),
 * recalculate the optimal route for this destination and finally broadcast
 * the change (if any) to all routing protocols by calling rte_announce().
 *
 * All memory used for attribute lists and other temporary allocations is taken
 * from a special linear pool @rte_update_pool and freed when rte_update()
 * finishes.
