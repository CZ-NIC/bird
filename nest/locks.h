/*
 *  The object locks are used for controlling exclusive access
 *  to various physical resources like UDP ports on specific devices.
 *  When you want to access such resource, you ask for a object lock
 *  structure, fill in specification of the object and your function
 *  you want to have called when the object is available and invoke
 *  olock_acquire() afterwards. When the object becomes free, the lock
 *  manager calls your function. To free the object lock, just call rfree
 *  on its resource.
