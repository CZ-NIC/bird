  o Filter: New 'weight' route attribute
  o Filter: BGP path mask loop operator

  Notes:

  Automatic channel reloads based on RPKI changes are enabled by default,
  but require import table enabled when used in BGP import filter.

  BIRD now uses bitmaps to keep track of exported routes instead of
  re-evaluation of export filters. That should improve speed and accuracy in
  route export handling during reconfiguration, but takes some more memory.

  Per-channel debug logging and some CLI commands (like 'show ospf neighbors')
  defaulting to all protocol instances lead to some minor changes in log and
  CLI output. Caution is recommended when logs or CLI output are monitored by
  scripts.

  compatibility issues with proper implementations. The error is fixed in this
  version, therefore there are compatibility issues in OSPF NSSA areas between
  this and previous version.


Version 2.0.4 (2019-02-27)

  o OSPF: DN-bit handling (RFC 4576)

  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  Export of routes to RS EBGP (route server) sessions from other sources than
  RS EBGP sessions was changed that ASN is no longer prepended to BGP_PATH in
  that case. The change does not affect regular BGP configurations or regular
  route servers that have only RS EBGP peers.

  For BGP route servers and route reflectors, the default value of option
  'next hop keep' was changed to a more appropriate value.

  Attributes for OSPF and Babel metrics are no longer reset when exported to
  these protocols and could be set anywhere in BIRD. As a result, OSPF metric is
  kept when a route is reannounced between OSPF instances. Also, when route is
  exported to OSPF with both ospf_metric1 and ospf_metric2 attributes it is now
  propagated as OSPF-E2 route instead of as OSPF-E1 route.

  Compiling BIRD with --enable-debug no longer automatically activates debug
  mode (-d option) nor local mode (-l option). Also, debug mode with output to
  file (-D option) no longer not forces foreground mode (-f option).

  The configure script now uses standard option --runstatedir, the old option
  --with-runtimedir is deprecated.

  explicit configuration of import and export policies.

  are now connected by explicit channels, most related protocol options (table,
  import, export, ...) are now channel options. See doc/bird.conf.example2 for
  configuration examples. Some options were removed/replaced.
