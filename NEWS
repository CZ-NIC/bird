Version 2.14 (2023-10-06)
  o MPLS subsystem
  o L3VPN: BGP/MPLS VPNs (RFC 4364)
  o BGP: Access to unknown route attributes
  o RAdv: Custom options
  o Babel: RTT metric extension
  o BMP: Refactored route monitoring
  o BMP: Multiple instances of BMP protocol
  o BMP: Both pre-policy and post-policy monitoring
  o Experimental route aggregation
  o Filter: Method framework
  o Filter: Functions have return type statements
  o Filter: New bytestring data type
  o Kernel: Option to learn kernel routes
  o Many bugfixes and improvements

  Notes:

  User-defined filter functions that return values now should have return type
  statements. We still accept functions without such statement, if they could be
  properly typed.

  For loops allowed to use both existing iterator variables or ones defined in
  the for statement. We no longer support the first case, all iterator variables
  must be defined in the for statement (e.g. 'for int i in bgp_path ...').

  Due to oversight, VRF interfaces were not included in respective VRFs, this is
  fixed now.


Version 2.13.1 (2023-06-23)
  o BGP: Fix role check when no capability option is present
  o Filter: Fixed segfault when a case option had an empty block

  This is a bugfix version.

Version 2.13 (2023-04-21)
  o Babel: IPv4 via IPv6 extension (RFC 9229)
  o Babel: Improve authentication on lossy networks
  o BGP: New 'allow bgp_med' option
  o BSD: Support for IPv4 routes with IPv6 nexthop on FreeBSD
  o Experimental BMP protocol implementation
  o Important bugfixes

  Notes:

  We changed versioning scheme from <epoch>.<major>.<minor> to more common
  <major>.<minor>.<patch> . From now on, you may expect that BIRD 2.13.x will be
  strictly only fixing bugs found in 2.13, whereas BIRD 2.14 will also contain
  new features.

  This BIRD version contains an alpha release of BMP protocol implementation.
  It is not ready for production usage and therefore it is not compiled by
  default and have to be enabled during installation.


Version 2.0.12 (2023-01-23)
  o Filter: New 'onlink' route attribute
  o Compile-time option to use 4-way tries instead of 16-way ones
  o BSD: Support for kernel route metric and other improvements
  o Important bugfixes

Version 2.0.11 (2022-11-12)
  o BGP roles (RFC 9234)
  o BGP: Keepalive time scaling
  o BGP: New 'min hold time' and 'min keepalive time' options
  o BGP: New 'next hop prefer global' option
  o Filter: For loops and direct recursion
  o Filter: Mixed declarations of local variables
  o Filter: Improved static type checks
  o Filter: Literal [] for empty set
  o Linux: Netlink KRT improvements
  o BSD: Experimental support for Netlink API
  o Memory management improvements
  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  In contrast to prior versions, configured keepalive time in BGP now scales
  with negotiated hold time to maintain proportion between the keepalive time
  and the hold time.

  The Linux KRT was updated to use the recent API for IPv6 ECMP routes instead
  of the legacy one. Consequently, the Linux versions older than 4.11 are no
  longer supported, at least for IPv6 ECMP routes. Also, routing table scanning
  now runs separately for each table to avoid congestion.

  There is a minor change in recursive next hop processing. Previously,
  recursive next hop must be resolved through a non-recursive route, now it must
  be resolved through a prefix where both the best route and all routes with the
  same preference (as the best route) are non-recursive. The old behavior might
  lead in some corner cases to an infinite loop of recursive next hop resolution
  due to a priority inversion.

  There is a minor change in the 'configure undo' command, it is no longer
  available after failed reconfiguration, as the old configuration is already
  released.


Version 2.0.10 (2022-06-16)
  o BGP performance improvements
  o BFD: New 'strict bind' option
  o RPKI: VRF support
  o Allow use of 240.0.0.0/4 as a private range
  o BIRD client uses exit status to report errors
  o Important bugfixes

Version 2.0.9 (2022-02-09)
  o BGP: Flowspec validation procedure
  o Babel: MAC authentication support
  o Routing table configuration blocks
  o Optional prefix trie in routing table for faster LPM/interval queries
  o CLI: New 'show route in <prefix>' command
  o Filter: Faster (16-way) prefix sets
  o Filter: MPLS label route attribute
  o Filter: Operators to pick community components
  o Filter: Operators to find minimum and maximum element of lists
  o BGP: New 'free bind' option
  o BGP: Log route updates that were changed to withdraws
  o BGP: Improved 'invalid next hop' error reporting
  o OSPF: Allow ifaces with host address as unnumbered PtP or PtMP ifaces
  o OSPF: All packets on PtP networks should be sent to AllSPFRouters address
  o Scripts for apkg-powered upstream packaging for deb and rpm
  o Support for Blake2s and Blake2b hash functions
  o Security keys / passwords can be entered in hexadecimal digits
  o Memory statistics split into Effective and Overhead
  o Linux: New option 'netlink rx buffer' to specify netlink socket buffer size
  o BSD: Assume onlink flag on ifaces with only host addresses
  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  For OSPF on PtP network, BIRD now sends all packets to multicast AllSPFRouters
  address (as required in RFC 2328 8.1). This likely breaks setups with multiple
  neighbors on a network configured as PtP, which worked in previous versions.
  Such links should be configured as PtMP.

  Since Linux 5.3, netlink socket can be flooded by route cache entries during
  route table scan. This version mitigates that issue by using strict netlink
  filtering.


Version 2.0.8 (2021-03-18)
  o Automatic channel reloads based on RPKI changes
  o Multiple static routes with the same network
  o Use bitmaps to keep track of exported routes

  o Filter: New 'weight' route attribute
  o Filter: BGP path mask loop operator
  o Filter: Remove quitbird command
  o RIP: Demand circuit support (RFC 2091)
  o BGP: New 'allow as sets' and 'enforce first as' options
  o BGP: Support for BGP hostname capability
  o BGP: Support for MD5SIG with dynamic BGP
  o BFD: Optional separation of IPv4 / IPv6 BFD instances
  o BFD: Per-peer session options
  o RPKI: Allow build without libSSH
  o RPKI: New 'ignore max length' option
  o OSPF: Redesign of handling of unnumbered PtPs
  o OSPF: Allow key id 0 in authentication
  o Babel: Use onlink flag for routes with unreachable next hop
  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  Automatic channel reloads based on RPKI changes are enabled by default,
  but require import table enabled when used in BGP import filter.

  BIRD now uses bitmaps to keep track of exported routes instead of
  re-evaluation of export filters. That should improve speed and accuracy in
  route export handling during reconfiguration, but takes some more memory.

  Per-channel debug logging and some CLI commands (like 'show ospf neighbors')
  defaulting to all protocol instances lead to some minor changes in log and
  CLI output. Caution is recommended when logs or CLI output are monitored by
  scripts.


Version 2.0.7 (2019-10-11)
  o BGP: Accumulated IGP metric (RFC 7311)

  o BGP: Promiscuous ASN mode
  o BGP: Mandatory option for channels
  o BFD: Support for VRFs
  o Graceful restart command
  o Redesigned filtering code
  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  Previous version introduced an error in handling of OSPF NSSA-LSA, causing
  compatibility issues with proper implementations. The error is fixed in this
  version, therefore there are compatibility issues in OSPF NSSA areas between
  this and previous version.


Version 2.0.4 (2019-02-27)
  o OSPF: Opaque LSAs (RFC 5250)
  o OSPF: DN-bit handling (RFC 4576)
  o Preferred route counters are back
  o Important BGP bugfix
  o Several bugfixes related to route propagation
  o some minor bugfixes

Version 2.0.3 (2019-01-05)
  o MRT table dumps (RFC 6396)
  o BGP Long-lived graceful restart
  o BGP: Optional import table (Adj-RIB-In)

  o Perf: Protocol to measure BIRD performance internally
  o More verbose error messages in config processing
  o Log file size limit / log rotation
  o Many bugfixes

  Notes:

  Export of routes to RS EBGP (route server) sessions from other sources than
  RS EBGP sessions was changed that ASN is no longer prepended to BGP_PATH in
  that case. The change does not affect regular BGP configurations or regular
  route servers that have only RS EBGP peers.

  For BGP route servers and route reflectors, the default value of option
  'next hop keep' was changed to a more appropriate value.

  Attributes for OSPF and Babel metrics are no longer reset when exported to
  these protocols and could be set anywhere in BIRD. As a result, OSPF metric is
  kept when a route is reannounced between OSPF instances. Also, when route is
  exported to OSPF with both ospf_metric1 and ospf_metric2 attributes it is now
  propagated as OSPF-E2 route instead of as OSPF-E1 route.

  Compiling BIRD with --enable-debug no longer automatically activates debug
  mode (-d option) nor local mode (-l option). Also, debug mode with output to
  file (-D option) no longer not forces foreground mode (-f option).

  The configure script now uses standard option --runstatedir, the old option
  --with-runtimedir is deprecated.


Version 2.0.2 (2018-03-22)
  o Source-specific routing support for Linux kernel and Babel
  o BGP: New option 'disable after cease'
  o Filter: Allow silent filter execution

  o Linux MPLS kernel support
  o Better handling of channels inherited from templates
  o Default EBGP Route Propagation Behavior without Policies (RFC 8212)

  Notes:

  To satisfy requirements of RFC 8212, external BGP protocols now require
  explicit configuration of import and export policies.

  o Integrated IPv4 + IPv6 design
  o Support for MPLS next hops
  o Support for VPNv4 and VPNv6 networks

  Notes:

  Tables are now defined with appropriate net type keyword. Protocols and tables
  are now connected by explicit channels, most related protocol options (table,
  import, export, ...) are now channel options. See doc/bird.conf.example2 for
  configuration examples. Some options were removed/replaced.

     - BGP: Option 'start delay time' renamed to 'connect delay time'.
     - BGP: Option 'route limit' deprecated.

  Upgrade notes:

  For OSPF, there are deep internal changes, but user-visible changes
  are limited to log messages and minor changes in formatting of command
  output.

  For BGP, version 1.5.0 is essentially a minor release. There are two
  deprecated options ('start delay time' and 'route limit') and some
  minor formatting changes.

  o Several minor bugfixes.

Version 1.2.0 (2010-01-05)
  o Implements OSPFv3 (IPv6 support for OSPF). Because the code is
    shared with OSPFv2 and there were deep changes in it, we suggest
    caution during upgrade to OSPF users. Some advanced features
    (like NSSA, vlinks and authentication) are not yet implemented.
  o Implements MRTdump - binary logging protocol compatible with other
    routing daemons. Only BGP part of MRTdump is yet implemented.
  o Changes default value of BGP attribute LOCAL_PREF from 0 to 100.
    Use 'default bgp_local_pref 0' BGP protocol option for the old
    behavior. The new value is suggested by RFC 4277.
  o Changes default mode of pipes from opaque to transparent.
    Use 'mode opaque' protocol option if the old behavior is needed.
    Opaque pipe mode is deprecated and might be removed in the future.
