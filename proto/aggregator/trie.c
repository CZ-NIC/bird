/**
 * DOC: Aggregator protocol trie
 *
 * Prefix aggregation implements the ORTC (Optimal Route Table Construction)
 * algorithm [1].
 *
 * This algorithm uses a binary tree representation of the routing table.
 * An edge from the parent node to its left child represents bit 0, and
 * an edge from the parent node to its right child represents bit 1 as the
 * prefix is traversed from the most to the least significant bit. Last node
 * of every prefix contains original bucket where the route for this prefix
 * belongs.
 *
 * Prefixes are therefore represented as a path through the trie, beginning at
 * the root node. The last node on this path is called prefix node.
 *
 *** The Original Algorithm ***
 *
 * ORTC algorithm as described in the original paper consists of three passes
 * through the trie. (This is not exactly how this is implemented here.)
 *
 * The first pass adds new nodes to the trie so that every node has either two
 * or zero children. During this pass, routing information is propagated to the
 * leaves.
 *
 * The second pass finds the most prevalent buckets by pushing information from
 * the leaves up towards the root. Each node is assigned a set of potential
 * buckets. If there are any common buckets among the node's children, they
 * are carried to the parent node. Otherwise, all of children's buckets are
 * carried to the parent node.
 *
 * The third pass moves down the trie while deciding which prefixes will be
 * exported to the FIB. The node inherits a bucket from its closest ancestor
 * that has a bucket. If the inherited bucket is one of potential buckets of
 * this node, then this node does not need a bucket and its prefix will not
 * be in FIB. Otherwise the node does need a bucket and any of its potential
 * buckets can be chosen. We always choose the bucket with the lowest ID.
 * This prefix will go to the FIB.
 *
 * Algorithm works with the assumption that there is a default route.
 *
 *** Our Implementation ***
 *
 * Description of this implementation follows.
 *
 * Route attributes are represented as buckets. All routes with the same set of
 * attributes matched by the "aggregate on" config clause get the same bucket.
 *
 * The trie contains three different kinds of nodes: original, aggregated and
 * fillers.
 *
 * - Original nodes represent prefixes from the original (import) routing table.
 * - Aggregated nodes represent prefixes that do not exist in the original table
 *   but do exist in the aggregated (export) table.
 * - Filler nodes exist neither in original or aggregated table, they represent
 *   prefixes "on the way" to the original or aggregated nodes.
 *
 * Each node has a FIB status flag signalling whether this prefix was exported
 * to the FIB (IN_FIB) or not (NON_FIB). It is clear that IN_FIB nodes can be
 * either original or aggregated, whereas NON_FIB nodes can be either original
 * or fillers.
 *
 * Every node contains pointer to its closest IN_FIB ancestor. If the node is
 * IN_FIB, the ancestor pointer points to itself.
 *
 * After every aggregation, following invariants are always satisfied:
 *
 *   1. All nodes have some bucket.
 *   2. All nodes have the IN_FIB ancestor pointer set.
 *   3. If a node is IN_FIB, then
 *        a) its selected bucket must not be null,
 *        b) its ancestor pointer must point to itself,
 *        c) it must be ORIGINAL or AGGREGATED.
 *   4. If a node is NON_FIB, then
 *        a) its selected bucket must be null,
 *        b) its ancestor pointer must point to the closest IN_FIB ancestor,
 *        c) it must be ORIGINAL or FILLER.
 *
 * Our implementation differs from the algorithm as described in the original
 * paper in several aspects:
 *
 * - We do not normalize the trie by adding new nodes. This way, nodes may
 *   have one child (not only zero or two).
 * - The first pass is merged with the second pass. These two passes together
 *   are named propagate_and_merge().
 * - The third pass is called group_prefixes().
 *
 * The Aggregator is capable of processing incremental updates in the following
 * way. After receiving an update, which can be either announce or withdraw:
 *
 *    1. The corresponding node is found in the trie and its original bucket
 *       is updated. The trie now needs to be recomputed to reflect this update.
 *    2. The trie is traversed from the updated node upwards until its closest
 *	 IN_FIB ancestor is found. This is the prefix node that covers an
 *	 address space which is directly affected by the received update.
 *    3. The propagate_and_merge() pass is started for the subtree rooted in
 *	 the node found in the previous step. This pass propagates buckets
 *	 eligible for selection from the leaves upwards.
 *    4. Merging of sets of eligible buckets may leak from the subtree upwards
 *       by computing a different eligible bucket set for the node selected in
 *       step 2. In this case, we continue upwards until the computed set is equal
 *       with the previous one.
 *    5. From the last node changed in the last step, the group_prefixes()
 *	 is started downwards.
 *    6. When this function decides to change IN_FIB status or exchange the
 *       selected bucket, either route update is done immediately, or route
 *       retraction is scheduled for later to avoid short-term misroutings.
