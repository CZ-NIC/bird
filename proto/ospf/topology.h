/*
 * LSA entry life cycle
 *
 * LSA entries are created by ospf_originate_lsa() (for locally originated LSAs)
 * or ospf_install_lsa() (for LSAs received from neighbors). A regular (like
 * newly originated) LSA entry has defined lsa_body nad lsa.age < %LSA_MAXAGE.
 * When the LSA is requested to be flushed by ospf_flush_lsa(), the lsa.age is
 * set to %LSA_MAXAGE and flooded. Flush process is finished asynchronously,
 * when (at least) flooding is acknowledged by neighbors. This is detected in
 * ospf_update_lsadb(), then ospf_clear_lsa() is called to free the LSA body but
 * the LSA entry is kept. Such LSA does not formally exist, we keep an empty
 * entry (until regular timeout) to know inst_time and lsa.sn in the case of
 * later reorigination. After the timeout, LSA is removed by ospf_remove_lsa().
 *
 * When LSA origination is requested (by ospf_originate_lsa()). but it is not
 * possible to do that immediately (because of MinLSInterval or because the
 * sequence number is wrapping), The new LSA is scheduled for later origination
 * in next_lsa_* fields of the LSA entry. The later origination is handled by
 * ospf_originate_next_lsa() called from ospf_update_lsadb(). We can see that
 * both real origination and final flush is asynchronous to ospf_originate_lsa()
 * and ospf_flush_lsa().
 *
 * LSA entry therefore could be in three basic states:
 * R - regular (lsa.age < %LSA_MAXAGE, lsa_body != NULL)
 * F - flushing (lsa.age == %LSA_MAXAGE, lsa_body != NULL)
 * E - empty (lsa.age == %LSA_MAXAGE, lsa_body == NULL)
 *
 * And these states are doubled based on whether the next LSA is scheduled
 * (next_lsa_body != NULL, -n suffix) or not (next_lsa_body == NULL). We also
 * use X for a state of non-existentce. We have this basic state graph
 * (transitions from any state to R are omitted for clarity):
 *
 *  X --> R ---> F ---> E --> X
 *        | \  / |      |
 *        |  \/  |      |
 *        |  /\  |      |
 *        | /  \ |      |
 *        Rn --> Fn --> En
 *
 * The transitions are:
 *
 * any state -> R		- new LSA origination requested and executed
 * R -> Rn, F -> Fn, E -> En	- new LSA origination requested and postponed
 * R -> Fn			- new LSA origination requested, seqnum wrapping
 * Rn,Fn,En -> R		- postponed LSA finally originated
 * R -> R			- LSA refresh done
 * R -> Fn			- LSA refresh with seqnum wrapping
 * R -> F, Rn -> Fn		- LSA age timeout
 * R,Rn,Fn -> F, En -> E	- LSA flush requested
 * F -> E, Fn -> En		- LSA flush done (acknowledged)
 * E -> X			- LSA real age timeout (or immediate for received LSA)
 *
 * The 'origination requested' and 'flush requested' transitions are triggered
 * and done by ospf_originate_lsa() and ospf_flush_lsa(), the rest is handled
 * asynchronously by ospf_update_lsadb().
 *
 * The situation is significantly simpler for non-local (received) LSAs - there
 * is no postponed origination and after flushing is done, LSAs are immediately
 * removed, so it is just X -> R -> F -> X, or X -> F -> X (when MaxAge LSA is
 * received).
 *
 * There are also some special cases related to handling of received unknown
 * self-originated LSAs in ospf_advance_lsa():
 * X -> F		- LSA is received and immediately flushed
 * R,Rn -> Fn		- LSA with MaxSeqNo received and flushed, current LSA scheduled

/*
 * LSA entry modes:
 *
 * LSA_M_BASIC - The LSA is explicitly originated using ospf_originate_lsa() and
 * explicitly flushed using ospf_flush_lsa(). When the LSA is changed, the
 * routing table calculation is scheduled. This is also the mode used for LSAs
 * received from neighbors. Example: Router-LSAs, Network-LSAs.
 *
 * LSA_M_EXPORT - like LSA_M_BASIC, but the routing table calculation does not
 * depend on the LSA. Therefore, the calculation is not scheduled when the LSA
 * is changed. Example: AS-external-LSAs for exported routes.
 *
 * LSA_M_RTCALC - The LSA has to be requested using ospf_originate_lsa() during
 * each routing table calculation, otherwise it is flushed automatically at the
 * end of the calculation. The LSA is a result of the calculation and not a
 * source for it. Therefore, the calculation is not scheduled when the LSA is
 * changed. Example: Summary-LSAs.
 *
 * LSA_M_STALE - Temporary state for LSA_M_RTCALC that is not requested during
 * the current routing table calculation.
 *
 *
 * Note that we do not schedule the routing table calculation when the age of
 * LSA_M_BASIC LSA is changed to MaxAge because of the sequence number wrapping,
 * As it will be switched back to a regular one ASAP.
