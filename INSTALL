How to install BIRD
===================

$ ./configure
$ make
# make install

Default location for configuration file is /usr/local/etc/bird.conf and
for control socket is /usr/local/var/run/bird.ctl . You can change that
by --prefix, --sysconfdir and --runstatedir configure options, e.g.:

$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --runstatedir=/run

To compile current development BIRD source code from Git repository, you
also need Git (to download the source code) and Autoconf (to generate
the configure script and associated files using 'autoreconf' tool):

$ git clone https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/labs/bird/
$ cd bird
$ autoreconf

Then continue as in usual installation above.
