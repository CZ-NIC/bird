This is `linuxdoc-tools', a series of tools to implement the Linux
Documentation Project HOWTO and book styles in SGML.

This copy was modified in order to work with birddoc DTD. It is
based on version 0.9.73-2 from Debian 10.


----------------------------------
    The linuxdoc-tools license
----------------------------------

linuxdoc-tools is derived from linuxdoc-SGML, originally written by
Matt Welsh and later maintained by Cees de Groot. Linuxdoc-SGML is
based on James Clark's sgmls parser, and the QWERTZ DTD by Tom
Gordon. Magnus Alvestad provided the current HTML support. For
the rest of linuxdoc-SGML,

  Copyright (C) 1994-1996 Matt Welsh <mdw@cs.cornell.edu>
  Copyright (C) 1996-1998 Cees de Groot <cg@pobox.com>

Original Linuxdoc-SGML itself does not have any limitations.
Everything not having explicit additional conditions can be freely
used, modified, and redistributed, under the usual fair use clauses:

 * No warranty. Use at your own risk.
 * Do not pretend to have written what you did not (Preserve credits
   and Copyright notices of the different elements if present).

Since then, lots of smaller and bigger changes resulted in a rename
to SGML-Tools (and then to SGMLtools, the hyphen caused confusion)
to indicate that it wasn't just for Linux anymore. See files
CHANGES.old-v1 and CONTRIBUTORS.old-v1 for changelog and list of
contributors to old linuxdoc-sgml and sgmltools-v1.

When sgml-tools dropped support for the linuxdoc DTD, Taketoshi Sano
<sano@debian.org> forked the code to linuxdoc-tools. See README file.
